    DisableRewards: false
    # Set the delay between the automatic save-intervals. Set to 0 to disable auto-saving (not recommended!).
    # As this Plugin only writes and reads data form files/mysql upon play login and quit, there may be a chance to data-loss
    # when the server crashes. Auto-Save writes all data every interval to files/mysql. This prevents data-loss.
